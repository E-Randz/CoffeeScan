# CoffeeScan
My work on Colt Steels WD Bootcamp module YelpCamp. Adpated to suit my minor coffee addiction

Colt Steel's Bootcamp creates a simple Yelp-style app, specifically for campsites, with the use of JS, Node.js, npm and Express.js.
As I am learning JavaScript, I will be following along but adapting it to list the coffeeshops in my local area. As the bootcamp came
out a few years ago on Udemy, it is my hope to make use of more recent language features in ES6 as well as producing responsive pages 
with a CSS grid layout, instead of Bootstrap.
