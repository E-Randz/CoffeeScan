# CoffeeScan
My work on Colt Steels WD Bootcamp module YelpCamp. Adpated to suit my minor coffee addiction

Colt Steel's Bootcamp creates a simple Yelp-style app, specifically for campsites, with the use of JS, Node.js, npm and Express.js. The database will be noSQL using MongoDB with Mongoose.

As I am learning JavaScript, I will be following along but adapting it to list the coffeeshops in my local area. As the bootcamp came
out a few years ago on Udemy, it is my hope to make use of more recent language features in ES6, eventually. After creating the first iteration of the full website, I will use CSS grid instead of Bootstrap to make the page responsive.
